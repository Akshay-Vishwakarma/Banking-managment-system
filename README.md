# Banking-managment-system
This Banking Management System project was developed to automate various banking operations, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of managing accounts, processing transactions, and handling loan requests. By leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, and functions, the system achieves a well-structured and modular codebase, which enhances maintainability and scalability.

The __init__() function is used effectively to initialize essential account details, such as account number, holderâ€™s name, and balance, ensuring each account is accurately set up when created. The system includes key functionalities like crediting and debiting funds, enabling seamless and secure financial transactions for both customers and bank staff. Additionally, the project provides features for checking balances and managing loans, making it a comprehensive tool for banking operations.

Overall, this project highlights the practical application of OOP principles in building real-world banking solutions that prioritize security, reliability, and user convenience, while also streamlining backend processes for bank employees.
